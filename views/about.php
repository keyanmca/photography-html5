            About me
        </h3>
        <p>
            I have been shooting photos as a hobby for almost ten years now and moved from using compact and bridge cameras to proper Digital SLRs almost four years ago. Digital SLRs have given me far more freedom to experiement, learn and create much better photos.

            I do this primarily as a hobby and as a creative outlet and love to experiment with subjects and light. I also work full time as a web developer professionally and created this site to hone my HTML5 and CSS3 skills so this site embodies my passion of photography, design and development in a nice simple bundle.

            I have experimented with many different types of photography and produced some surprising results but the main thing I have learned is to keep at it and keep practicing. I take my camera with me almost everywhere I go and try to get the timing right when shooting landscapes.

            At the moment I am shooting and filming a lot of gigs and concerts in Dublin and publishing my work in online blogs such as <a hreg="http://www.littlegreen.ie/" title="Littlegreen.ie">Littlegreen.ie</a> which I also developed.

            I want to start shooting more band photos and festivals. This year I will be going along to <a href="http://www.vantastival.com" title="Vantastival">Vantastival</a> and <a href="http://www.spiritoffolk.com">Spirit of Folk</a>.
